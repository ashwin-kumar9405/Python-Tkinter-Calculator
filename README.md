#  Python-Tkinter-Calculator


 Project Description

This project is a graphical calculator application developed using Python and Tkinter.
The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
It features a clean user interface with styled buttons and a full-width clear bar for better usability.

This project demonstrates my understanding of GUI development, event handling, layout management, and error handling in Python.

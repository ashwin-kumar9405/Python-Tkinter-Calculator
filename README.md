# 🧮 Python-Tkinter-Calculator


🧠 Project Description

This project is a graphical calculator application developed using Python and Tkinter.
The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
It features a clean user interface with styled buttons and a full-width clear bar for better usability.

This project demonstrates my understanding of GUI development, event handling, layout management, and error handling in Python.

🎯 Objectives

To design a user-friendly calculator using Python

To understand Tkinter widgets and layouts

To implement event-driven programming

To handle runtime errors gracefully

To write clean and optimized code

🛠️ Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python 3
